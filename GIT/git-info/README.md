## VCS (Version Control System)


A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps manage and track changes to files, especially source code. 

VCS enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, while keeping a record of every change made to the project over time. 



## Why Version Control is Important


### Collaboration :- 

In team environments, developers and other stakeholders may work on the same files simultaneously.

VCS allows each individual to work on their own part of the project without conflicting with others' work.


### Track Changes :- 

VCS provides a history of changes made to the project. 

This allows developers to view who made a change, what the change was, and when it occurred.

### Undo Changes :- 

If a mistake is made, a VCS allows developers to revert to an earlier version of a file or the entire project, avoiding the loss of work.

### Branching and Merging :- 

VCS allows the creation of branches, so developers can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project. 

These branches can later be merged back.

### Backup :- 

The VCS keeps a record of all versions, providing a backup for projects. 

In case of an issue (such as data corruption or accidental deletion), previous versions can be restored.
